The Eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan is home to the Eastern
Upper Peninsula National Defense Complex. The EUP-NDC sits on
1700-acres of pre-existing strategic infrastructure and land
within and directly adjacent to Chippewa County International
Airport in Kincheloe, Michigan. This infrastructure once served as
a Strategic Air Command (SAC) base (Kincheloe AB) form 1942-1977.

The climate of the Eastern Upper Peninsula acts as a
differentiator amongst all other RDT&E defense enviornments across
the nation. The temperature of the region scales from -37°F to
98°F, with a majority of the year spent under an abundance of snow
and ice in result of the lake effect snow coming off of Lake
Superior. Lake Superior is deepest and coldest of the Great Lakes
and is the largest fresh water lake by area, accounting for 10% of
the entire worlds surface freshwater, Lake Superior acts as a main
differentiator for the EUP-NDC. The EUP provides defense
contractors the unique opportunity to design and test their
defense solutions in an organic austere environment.

The Eastern Upper Peninsula - National Defense Complex (EUP-NDC)
is a profound response to the Nation's call for innovation in support of
the Warfighter. The EUP-NDC is a bold, first-of-its-kind Research,
Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDT&E) complex and Rapid Capability
Development – Delivery (RCD-D) platform, purpose-built for the
All-Domain (air, land, maritime, cyber, and space) Warfare fight versus
sophisticated adversaries (i.e., China and Russia).
`;

export const missionTwo = `
Unlike other federally-funded RDT&E and RCD-D constructs, the
EUP-NDC is unique in that it delivers comprehensive austere-capable
All-Domain solutions (i.e., cradle to grave) from one centralized and
secure location, dramatically increasing efficiency, maximizing cost
effectiveness, while ultimately accelerating the delivery technical and
tactical advantage to the Warfighter.

The EUP-NDC is an Anchor Systems Initiative. Anchor Systems is a
national defense technology integrator specializing in the integration
of emergent technology and applied engineering. Anchor Systems is
mission focused on the design development and delivery of next
generation war fighting capabilities, specifically in accelerating the
critical capabilities necessary for America’s warfighters to fight and
win in tomorrow’s battlespace today.
