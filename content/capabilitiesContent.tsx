The Eastern Upper Peninsula National Defense Complex has the ability to
evolve, experiment and deliver technologies to address both urgent and
emerging threats across the world. Rapid Capability Development and
Delivery (RCD-D) processes within the National Defense Complex
encompasses everything from rapid manufacturing to advanced engineering
to take next generation war fighting technologies from cradle to grave.

The Eastern Upper Peninsula National Defense Complex is a bold concept, 
an advanced All-Domain Warfare Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation (RDT&E) platform 
â€“ capable of accelerated DoD Rapid Capability Development and Delivery (RCD-D) support operations. 
Set-up for the next generation of innovative war fighters to come research, design, test, 
and evaluate capabilities in an environment that matches the next war front. 
`;

export const devBlurb = `
Prototyping, designing, and engineering the next generation of war fighting capabilities. 
Cutting edge solutions are created in a collaborative environment backed by extensive research, 
developed by some of the brightest minds, and with the best technology. 
The National Defense Complex provides an environment to rapidly develop 
capabilities in a domain that closely matches the next war front.
`;

export const testBlurb = `
True imitation of the next war front domain cannot be accurately created in an artificial environment. 
The National Defense Complex allows for warfighters from all over the world to come to a place 
where they can test their capabilities in an organic environment that matches the next fight. 
`;

export const evalBlurb = `
Data collection, performance measuring and reflection are essential in the RDT&E process. 
The National Defense Complex is deliberately designed for rapid evaluation. 
Product lines are tested, data is generated, data is parsed and from there conclusions are drawn. 
Evaluating performances of product lines in a state-of-the-art facility located 
directly in the testing environment allows for creative minds to make adjustments in the 
design stage, and then jump right back into the testing phase.
`;

export const researchBlurb = `
From curiosity comes questions, and from research comes knowledge. 
Knowledge is the gateway to the rest of the development process. 
Building a strong foundation of existing knowledge provides innovators with confidence 
and clarity of the design space before moving into the design phase. 
At the Eastern Upper Peninsula National Defense Complex research and merit are 
built into the core by relationships with a network of Subject Matter Experts (SME), 
and partners from around the country.`;

export const developOne = `
Innovation is a mindset at the National Defense Complex. Mixed
with technical expertise, deep operational experience and
imagination, complex war fighting solutions are solved and
capabilities are put into production
`

export const developTwo = `
Capabilities are engineered to withstand the harsh climate of an
austere environment. Engineers from all different backgrounds
work to mix creativity and technology to design and prototype
capabilities across all domains.
`

export const developThree = `
Manufacturing is the overlap of innovation and engineering.
Integration of AI-enabled design and innovative fabrication
results in cutting-edge, top of the line capabilities being
shipped directly to the war fighter

The EUP-NDC sits directly on the former Kincheloe Air Force
Base. With direct access to the existing airport structure the
NDC has the capability to land a C-17, load it, and send it back
out in a rapid time frame.
`
export const deliveryTwo = `
The EUP-NDC is strategically located just off I-75 in Kincheloe,
Michigan, and 22 miles from the US and Canada International
Bridge.
`
export const deliveryThree = `
Just miles from the shore of Lake Superior, Lake Huron and Lake
Michigan the NDC provides the unique option of delivery
utilizing the natural geographic features of the area.
`
export const deliveryFour = `
Two miles from the NDC sits the Kincheloe Railway Station. With
direct access through partners of the NDC this allows for rapid
capbaility delivery where ever there is a rail way.
